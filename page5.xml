					but the whole effect of the clause is destroyed by ordering, that if he should not be able to clear himself of the imputation "by evidence," he may clear

					By the forty-third clause, any White man meeting above seven slaves on a high road together, SHALL AND MAY WHIP EACH OF THEM, NOT EXCEEDING TWENTY LASHES
